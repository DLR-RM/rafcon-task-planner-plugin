# Built-in Planner

A built-in planner is not really built-in, there is just a built-in integration script for it. So the planner has to be downloaded, and the environment must be prepared manually. 

## The Fast Downward Planning System

All which has to be done is to run: 

`pip install --user --no-compile downward-dlr`

Now it should work.

## Fast-Forward Planning System v2.3

To prepare the Fast-Forward Planning System, the following steps have to be executed:

1. Download the system [FF-Page](https://fai.cs.uni-saarland.de/hoffmann/ff.html), [direct download Link](https://fai.cs.uni-saarland.de/hoffmann/ff/FF-v2.3.tgz) 
2. Extract the system and make it.
3. Add the path of the system to the PATH variable, to make the ff command available in the console.

Now it should work.
